SANDESHA2 INSTALL
=================

1. Getting Sandesha2C working with the source release on Linux
    - This version of Sandesha2C depends on Axis2C 1.0
        - Download Axis2C from http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/download.cgi and
          install.
    - Go to Sandesha2C source directory
    - Run configure with AXIS2 include path.
        ./configure --prefix=<axis2c_install_path>/modules --enable-static=no --with-axis2=<axis2c_install_path>
    - Run make and make install
   
Note: 1.
        Sandesha2 has two main storage mechanisms call inmemory and persistent. 
        By default sandesha2 use the sqlite as the persistent storage. You can
        change this to inmemory by changing the entry in the sandesha2_constants.h
        file.
            #define SANDESHA2_DEFAULT_STORAGE_MGR "persistent"

            You must have sqlite3.h in sandesha2 include directory.
            When compiling it statically link with sqlite library. So make sure you have
            src/core/libsqlite3.a.
            Above configurations regarding sqlite may be refined before the release.
        
      2.
       To run samples in persistent mode copy sandesha2c/config/sandesha2_schema.sh
       to both axis2c client and server deploy directory and execute it to create the database schema.
